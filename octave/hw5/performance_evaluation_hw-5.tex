\section*{Validation - Input}
I wrote a simple validator to find days whose data is nonexist. However, there are only three days which are provided by you in the email. I have filled them from previous week with corresponding day. Moreover, I added the latest days data from \textit{http://mathe.epfl.ch}. However, last day(3 May) wasn't completed and its value is very small compared neighbor days so I have used data from previous week not mess up forecast.

\section*{Difference}
Afterwards, I have adapted spring diff script on the website. I have used lag 1 and 8 to forecast. Basically, traffic depends on the regime from previous day and previous week in our assumption.
