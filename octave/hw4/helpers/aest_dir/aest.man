     aaaaeeeesssstttt is an implementation of the  scaling  estimator,  which
     estimates  the  tail  index  alpha of empirical heavy-tailed
     distributions.    It is described in the  paper  "Estimating
     the  Heavy  Tail  Index  from Scaling Properties" by Mark E.
     Crovella and Murad S. Taqqu.

     When applied to a dataset, the default behavior of the esti-
     mator  is  to  simply output the estimate of alpha obtained.
     Options can be used to direct it to output additional  files
     for  use  in  visualizing  the  scaling  properties  of  the
     dataset.

     ----ffff _d_a_t_a_f_i_l_e
               This option  specifies  the  file  containing  the
               input  data for the program.   The file is assumed
               to consist  of  floating-point  numbers,  one  per
               line.    Lines  beginning with # in the input file
               are ignored.

     ----nnnn _n_p_t_s    The number of points in the file (should be equal
               to the number of lines not starting with #)

     ----aaaa _a_g_g_r__f_a_c_t_o_r
               The factor used to form successive aggregations of
               the dataset. A good default is 2.

     ----llll _n_u_m_b_e_r__l_e_v_e_l_s
               The number of aggregations  (levels)  to  use.   A
               good default is 10.

     ----wwww        Using this option causes aaaaeeeesssstttt to write  out  files
               containing the log-log complementary distributions
               (LLCDs) that it  used  in  forming  its  estimate.
               These  files  can  be useful in graphically inter-
               preting the output from aaaaeeeesssstttt.... The  filenames  used
               have the format

               XXXX.sumNNNN.llcd

               where XXXX is the data filename supplied  via  the
               ----ffff  argument  and NNNN is the level of aggregation

               of the dataset used in  forming  the  LLCD.    The
               file  contains  <x,y>  pairs,  one per line;  this
               format is suitable for  plotting  in  gnuplot  and
               other  plotting packages.  In addition this option
               causes aaaaeeeesssstttt to write out a file named

               XXXX.aest.gp

               which contains  commands for the plotting  program
               gnuplot  that  will  instruct  it to plot the LLCD
               files.

     ----dddd        Using this option causes aaaaeeeesssstttt to write out a  file
               containg  all  of the trial alphas used in forming
               the alpha estimate.  The file's name has the  for-
               mat

               XXXX.alphas

               where XXXX is the data filename supplied  via  the
               ----ffff argument.

     ----gggg        Using this option causes aaaaeeeesssstttt to write out a  file
               containing  the  <x,y>  coordinates  of all of the
               points used in forming the alpha estimate.    This
               is  useful in conjunction with the llcd files out-
               put via the ----wwww option.

     ----tttt        (terse) only emit the estimate (if available).

     ----hhhh _n_u_m    change the threshold for relative  error  that  is
               used  to determine whether to accept a trial alpha
               estimate.  This corresponds to the parameter theta
               described in the paper.   Default value is 0.10.

     ----ssss        This option causes the LLCD  files  output  to  be
               subsampled.    The  LLCD files can be quite large,
               and typically will contain many points  that  have
               indistinguishable  locations on a plot.   The sub-
               sample option will only output  LLCD  points  that
               are more than 0.01 units apart in plotting coordi-
               nates.  The result is that the LLCD files are much
               smaller and yet when plotted still appear the same
               visually.

     ----rrrr _n_u_m    When used  in  conjunction  with  the  ----ssss  option,
               changes the threshold value used in subsampling to
               the value specified by nnnnuuuummmm....  For  example,  ----rrrr_0._0_2
               works  well and cuts the size of the LLCD files by
               another factor of two.

     ----ZZZZ        The default behavior of aaaaeeeesssstttt is  to  subtract  the
               dataset  mean  from all points before constructing
               the LLCDs.   Using this option skips the  zeromean
               subtraction step.
