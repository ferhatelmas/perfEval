Phase 1
For presentation:
- Exponential task size simulation will be done and compared to bounded pareto distribution
- Throughput and Utilization will be removed from performance metrics, they can only be shown for the correctness of the simulation.
- Final findings will be compared to the conclusions of the paper.
- Slowdown is important property, slowdown distribution will be shown for task size groups.
- References and used each formula will be added into presentation. 

Phase 2
For implementation:
- Queue lengths of the hosts
- Guessed steady state problem, modified implementation and increased end of simulation from 10^5 to 10^7
For presentation:
- Confidence interval and reference
